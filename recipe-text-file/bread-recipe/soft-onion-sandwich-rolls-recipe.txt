Ingredients
Original recipe yields 8 servings
Ingredient Checklist
¾ cup lukewarm milk
5 tablespoons lukewarm water
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 ½ teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons dried minced onion
¼ cup instant potato flakes
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water
¼ cup dried minced onion

Directions
Step 1
Place the milk, water, butter, salt, sugar, onion powder, 3 tablespoons of dried onion, potato flakes, flour and yeast into the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and press Start.

Step 2
When the cycle has completed, remove the dough from the machine, and knead on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 8 equal pieces, and form into balls. Gently flatten the balls until they are 4 inches in diameter. If they keep shrinking back, just let them relax for a minute before flattening. Place on a baking sheet, and cover loosely with a towel. Set in a draft-free place to rise until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.

Step 3
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the egg white and water in a cup. Brush over the tops of the risen rolls, and sprinkle with remaining minced onion.

Step 4
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool completely, then slice in half horizontally before using.
