Ingredients
Original recipe yields 4 servings
4 chicken leg quarters
1 (24 ounce) bag small potatoes
Â½ cup olive oil
2 lemons, juiced, divided
2 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lemon and herb seasoning
1 (12 ounce) package fresh green beans

Directions
Step 1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet with sides.

Step 2
Place chicken quarters on prepared baking sheet. Stir potatoes, olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and lemon herb seasoning together in a large bowl to coat potatoes. Arrange potatoes around chicken on baking sheet. Pour about 3/4 of oil mixture over chicken, reserving remaining oil; drizzle remaining lemon juice over chicken and potatoes.

Step 3
Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes; shake baking sheet to loosen potatoes, then continue baking for 15 minutes. Place green beans in reserved oil mixture; toss to coat. Remove chicken mixture from oven; pour green bean mixture over chicken and potatoes.

Step 4
Return pan to the oven; bake until green beans are tender with a bite, chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
