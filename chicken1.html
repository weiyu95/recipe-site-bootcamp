        <p>Instructions: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery.
                Cook,
                stirring every few
                minutes until the vegetables begin to soften; 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, while stirring the garlic around the pan, for about
                1
                minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a low simmer. Taste the soup then adjust the seasoning with
                salt
                and pepper.
                Depending on the stock used, you might need to add 1 or more teaspoons of salt.</li>
            <li>Submerge the chicken thighs into the soup so that the broth covers them. Bring the soup back to a
                low
                simmer then
                partially cover the pot with a lid and cook, stirring a few times until the chicken thighs are
                cooked
                through; about 20
                minutes.</li>
            <li>If, during this time, the broth seems low, add a splash more stock or a bit of water. Turn the heat
                to
                medium-low.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Stir the noodles into the soup and cook until done, 6 to 10
                minutes depending on
                the type of noodles used.</li>
            <li>While the noodles cook, shred the chicken into strips or dice into cubes. Slide the chicken back
                into
                the pot and then
                taste the soup once more for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper, as needed. Stir in the
                parsley
                and serve.</li>
        </ol>
